### Write a literature review on published papers about IR-Drop estimation in VLSI physical design 

#### Abstract
This literature review aims to summarize the fundamentals and advancements in IR-drop estimation methods used in VLSI physical design. This review covers state-of-the-art approaches for IR-drop estimation, including both analytical and numerical methods, as well as the challenges posed by increasing circuit complexity and design density. This review also provides a comprehensive overview of the major techniques used for IR-drop estimation, with a focus on the differences between each method and its relative strengths and weaknesses. 
#### Introduction
VLSI physical design is a critical component of the design process for modern electronic circuits. As circuit complexity and design density increase, the accuracy of interconnect-related design decisions, such as those related to IR-drop, becomes even more important. IR-drop is the voltage drop that tracks along interconnects as current passes through them due to their resistance. As such, it is critical to accurately estimate the IR-drop in VLSI physical design in order to ensure that no design rule violations occur and that the circuit performs as expected. 
### Analytical Methods
Analytical methods for IR-drop estimation are based on a set of equations that model the resistance and capacitance of the interconnects, as well as the current flowing through them. These equations can be solved using a variety of numerical methods and, when combined with the parasitic effects of the interconnects and the resistance of the power supply, can be used to accurately predict the IR-drop. The main advantage of analytical methods is that they are relatively straightforward to implement and can provide an accurate estimate of the IR-drop in a relatively short amount of time. 
#### Numerical Methods 
Numerical methods for IR-drop estimation are based on a set of equations that model the resistance, capacitance, and inductance of the interconnects, as well as the current flowing through them. These equations can be solved using various numerical methods, such as finite element analysis (FEA) or transmission line modeling (TLM). These methods are typically much more accurate than analytical methods, but they are also more computationally intensive and require more time to complete. They are also less able to cope with the increased complexity and design density of modern circuits. 
#### Conclusion
This literature review has provided an overview of several methods for IR-drop estimation used in VLSI physical design. It has discussed the advantages and disadvantages of both analytical and numerical methods, as well as the challenges posed by increasing circuit complexity and design density. This review has also provided an overview of the major techniques used for IR-drop estimation, with a focus on their differences and which method may be most appropriate for a given design.
